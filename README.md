# Movie Database Manager & Query
Currently creates a new SQL Database from IMDB datasets and allows the user to use SQL Queries on the database.

createDatabase.py allows the user to create a SQLite3 database from IMDB datasets.
useDatabase.py allows the user to search and get information from the database. Currently displays results in shell
and opens n new tabs in browsers for movies associated with the entry.

## Road Map
Greatly improve code as I learn more from about Python
For the love of god fix the lack of specified exceptions.
Implement a few other tables from other movie review sites.
Find and record movie mentions on Reddit with a list of keywords used to describe it. Weight the connotations for a "Reddit Score"
Create an interface for modifying search query.
Create a web interface to display results in a clean and reasonable manner.
Research security flaws.
Make more public.

Currently an independent learning project. Feel free to critique, I'm doing the project to learn by doing.

## About Me and the Project
This is the first thing I ever posted to GitHub and the first real project I have tried in Python. I'm self learning
to be a programmer to escape the construction industry. I have taken intro classes in C and Java in the past and ready to
try a new language and start making larger projects. Thanks for the read!
